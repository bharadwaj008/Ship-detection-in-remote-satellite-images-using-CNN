# Ship detection in remote satellite images using CNN
 Thanks for sharing the details of your CNN architecture. Hereâ€™s an updated README.md and project description for your GitHub repository that accurately reflects the custom architecture you've developed for ship detection.  ### Updated README.md for GitHub Repository  ---  **Project Title: Ship Detection in Satellite Images using Custom CNN**  **Overview:** This project employs a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and classify ships in satellite images. The model, built from scratch without using transfer learning, is tailored to meet the unique challenges of maritime surveillance. The application features a user-friendly Streamlit interface, enabling users to upload images and receive real-time ship detection results.  **Key Features:** - Custom-built CNN architecture for robust ship detection - Real-time prediction capability through a Streamlit interface - Data augmentation to ensure model robustness by balancing class representation  **Repository Structure:** - `ship-detection-using-custom-cnn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the CNN architecture, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. - `ship_prediction.py`: Streamlit application script for image upload and prediction. - `custom_cnn_model.h5`: Saved model weights for the custom CNN architecture.  **Requirements:** - Python 3.7+ - Jupyter Notebook - TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Streamlit  **Installation and Usage:** 1. Clone this repository. 2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure you create a requirements file based on the libraries mentioned). 3. Run the Jupyter notebook to understand the CNN architecture, data handling, and training process. 4. Execute `streamlit run ship_prediction.py` to launch the interactive application for ship detection.  **Dataset:** The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes satellite images categorized as "ship" and "no-ship". Data augmentation techniques were applied to balance the dataset, ensuring enhanced training effectiveness.  **Model Architecture:** The custom CNN model consists of multiple convolutional blocks with ReLU activation and batch normalization, followed by max pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The architecture culminates in a fully connected layer with a softmax output for classification. This robust structure efficiently processes satellite imagery for accurate ship detection.  **Limitations:** - Dependency on high-quality, diverse training data for optimal performance. - Requires substantial computational resources due to the complexity of the CNN. - Environmental variations in satellite images may impact model accuracy.  **Contributors:** - Sravani Peddamallu - Ganesula Chetna Srimayi  **Acknowledgments:** We thank the Kaggle community for providing the dataset essential for the successful execution of this project.  ---  ### Updated Project Description for GitHub  **Ship Detection in Satellite Images Using a Custom CNN**  This project demonstrates the application of a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network to effectively detect ships in satellite imagery.
